		<p>When examining the technical aspects of search engines combined with ethical implications, we argue that search engines need improvement and regulation. The internet and world wide web are a public good; search engines provide benefits for public interest, but this rests on the ethical issues we have covered: bias, censorship, and privacy. Currently, there are little to no laws regarding the prevention of the exploitation of users via biases in search results, which puts the public at risk. Search engines are the gatekeepers of knowledge and serve a variety of stakeholders: shareholders, sponsors, users, authors and creators of web content, and the general public. Therefore, developers of search engine technology have a duty to produce results that benefit everyone, which can be done by remaining as objective as possible. Users have the right to expect privacy, unbiased results, and no censorship - essentially this is the right to information.  For the greater good of the majority people search engine results must be objective in order to let users create their own decisions. To benefit and protect the majority of search engine users, we need legislation in order to address the current policy vacuum.
