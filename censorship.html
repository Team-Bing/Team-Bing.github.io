				<h3>1. The autocomplete blacklist</h3><br/>
				<p>
					This is a list of words and phrases that are excluded from the autocomplete feature in Google's search bar.
					The search bar instantly suggests multiple search options when you type words such as "democracy" or "watermelon," but it freezes when you type profanities, and, at times, it has frozen when people typed words like "torrent," "bisexual" and "penis."<br/>

				<h3>2.The Google Maps blacklist.</h3><br/>
				<p>
					Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt said. Google also maintains a list of properties it either blacks out or blurs out in its images. Some are probably military installations, some the residences of wealthy people, and some â€“ well, who knows? Martian pre-invasion enclaves? Google doesn't say.<br/>

				<h3>3.The search engine blacklist.</h3><br/>
				<p>
					Google's ubiquitous search engine has indeed become the gateway to virtually all information, handling 90 percent of search in most countries. It dominates search because its index is so large: Google indexes more than 45 billion web pages;
					 its next-biggest competitor, Microsoft's Bing, indexes a mere 14 billion, which helps to explain the poor quality of Bing's search results.<br/>
